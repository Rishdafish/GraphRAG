This repository demonstrates a **Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GraphRAG)** approach for optimizing hospital revenue cycles. By combining **ArangoDB** (for graph storage), **GPU-accelerated analytics** (NetworkX/cuGraph), and a **LangChain-based AI agent**, this solution delivers actionable insights on claim denials, coding inefficiencies, and potential revenue leaks.

## Overview

Hospitals often lose 3–5% of legitimate revenue due to fragmented data, undercoding, and preventable claim denials. This project addresses these challenges by:

- Modeling **clinical and financial data** (patients, encounters, diagnoses, procedures, claims) as a **graph** in ArangoDB.
- Applying **GPU-accelerated** graph algorithms (e.g., centrality, community detection) to uncover hidden denial patterns.
- Leveraging a **LangChain agent** for natural language querying and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).

**Key Goals:**
- Identify and reduce claim denials through proactive insights.
- Pinpoint undercoded or undocumented procedures.
- Enable real-time analytics on large healthcare datasets.

## Features

1. **Graph Database (ArangoDB):**
   - Stores patients, encounters, procedures, diagnoses, claims, and billing codes in a single, integrated graph.
   - Provides flexible AQL queries for data retrieval.

2. **GPU-Accelerated Analytics:**
   - Integrates cuGraph or NetworkX to run algorithms like PageRank, Louvain community detection, and more.
   - Speeds up analysis on large healthcare graphs.

3. **Agentic Querying (LangChain):**
   - Natural language queries are dynamically routed to either AQL, GPU analytics, or both.
   - Combines structured reasoning with large language model (LLM) insights.

4. **Visualization & Insights:**
   - Visualizes denial patterns, influential procedures, or financial bottlenecks via interactive or static graph layouts.
   - Generates user-friendly reports and recommended actions.
